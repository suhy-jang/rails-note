##### https://samuelmullen.com/2012/01/guidelines-for-using-activerecord-callbacks/
1. Use callbacks only if they can be run every time and in every circumstance they are triggered.
2. Never create callbacks which exceed the modelâ€™s responsibility.
3. If you have to stub callbacks during testing, you are violating one of the previous rules of thumb.
